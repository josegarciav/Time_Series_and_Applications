# Time Series and Applications - Class Materials


This repository contains class materials from the Time Series and Applications course taken during my Master's in Applied Mathematics. The course covered various topics in time series analysis, including statistical models, forecasting techniques, and practical applications.

## Course Overview
The Time Series and Applications course provided a comprehensive introduction to time series analysis and its applications in various domains. Topics covered in the course include:

* Introduction to Time Series Analysis
* Stationarity and Differencing
* Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation
* Autoregressive (AR) Models
* Moving Average (MA) Models
* Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models
* Seasonal Decomposition of Time Series (STL)
* Volatility models, ARCH, GARCH, impulse-response models
* State Space Model & Kalman filters
* Factor-Augmented VAR (FAVAR) model
* SVAR Models
* Model tests, evaluation and selection
